Synthesizing Unit <ControlModule>.
    Related source file is "ControlModule.v".
WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <Instr<25:6>> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
Unit <ControlModule> synthesized.


Synthesizing Unit <Npcmodule>.
    Related source file is "Npcmodule.v".
WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <InstrD<31:26>> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
WARNING:Xst:646 - Signal <imm2<31:30>> is assigned but never used. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 32-bit latch for signal <NPc>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

INFO:Xst:738 - HDL ADVISOR - 1024 flip-flops were inferred for signal <grf>. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.
